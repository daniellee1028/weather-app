# weather-app
My weather app made with Java 

This weather app allows users to input a city name to receive real-time weather data for the city including
weather, current temperature, lowest temperature, highest temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise time,
and sunset date. My WeatherApp focuses on implementing big data and HashMap techniques like API's.
